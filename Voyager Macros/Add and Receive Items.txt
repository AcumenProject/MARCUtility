-- Add Items Script
-- command syntax is: 
-- anything after a "--" is considered a comment 
-- each|once (once is default) -- run the commands below for each record in the current file, or the selected record (or just once) only 
--   a script can have a "once" part followed by an "each" part followed by another "once" part, and so on. 
--   Everything before the first once|each is effectively in its own "once" part 
-- ask prompt param1 param2 param3... (e.g. ask "Please enter your user name and password" name password*) 
--   parameters marked with asterisks are displayed as password fields 
-- set var_name "value"
--   assigns value to var_name
-- run command_file_name param1 param2 param3...  (e.g. run login name password) 
--   a parameter can be any variable (e.g. loaded via ask) or a function call such as: 
--   {marc field subfield regex_match}  -- everything except "field" is optional, so {marc a} is ok, as is {marc a b}, and {marc a b c} 
--   (if running "once" marc will use the selected record)
